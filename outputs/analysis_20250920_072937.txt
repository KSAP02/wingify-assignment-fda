RISK HEADLINE: Tesla's Q2 2025 financial performance indicates significant vulnerabilities amid declining revenues and profitability challenges.

TOP RISKS:
- Declining Vehicle Deliveries: A 13% year-over-year decrease in total vehicle deliveries reflects challenges in the automotive market.
- Increased Operating Expenses: Rising costs related to R&D and restructuring are impacting profitability, contributing to a 42% drop in operating income.
- Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Ongoing uncertainties from tariffs and fiscal policies may affect demand and operational costs.
- Competitive Pressure: Increased competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market could further pressure margins and market share.
- Regulatory Risks: Changes in government incentives and regulations for electric vehicles could adversely impact sales and operational costs.

RISK DRIVERS:
The decline in vehicle deliveries is primarily driven by increased competition and a reduction in average selling prices (ASP). The automotive segment's performance is further hampered by rising operational costs, particularly in R&D and restructuring efforts aimed at enhancing AI and robotics capabilities. Macroeconomic factors, including shifting tariffs and fiscal policies, create an uncertain environment that could dampen consumer demand. Additionally, the competitive landscape in the EV market is intensifying, which may lead to further erosion of Tesla's market share and profitability.

LIKELIHOOD & IMPACT:
| Risk                          | Likelihood | Impact  |
|-------------------------------|------------|---------|
| Declining Vehicle Deliveries   | High       | High    |
| Increased Operating Expenses    | High       | High    |
| Macroeconomic Uncertainty       | Medium     | High    |
| Competitive Pressure            | High       | Medium  |

RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS:
- Enhance marketing strategies to boost vehicle deliveries and maintain competitive pricing.
- Implement cost-control measures to manage rising operational expenses effectively.
- Diversify supply chains to mitigate risks associated with tariffs and regulatory changes.
- Invest in innovation to maintain a competitive edge in the EV market.

MONITORING / KPIs:
- Track vehicle delivery numbers and average selling prices monthly.
- Monitor operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to identify cost trends.
- Keep an eye on market share relative to competitors in the EV sector.
- Assess cash flow trends to ensure liquidity for ongoing investments.
- Watch for changes in government policies regarding EV incentives and regulations.
